        <h2>John</h2>
        <p>I chose these cards because I know these characters are from some of the animes you like. And you have 12 cards for the 12 first day of September. Each card has something special written on the back. The order in which you turn them doesn't matter, it's up to you. <br><br>Anyway, enjoy your gift</p>

              Home is in your arms and through your words. 
              Home is laughing until our stomach hurt and talking until we fall asleep.
              Home is finding ourselves with a love that let us be nothing but ourselves</p>

            <p>You came into my life at a time when I thought it was fine for me to not be able to love again. When I was sure that love was for other people. Now I'm realizing that I just needed to give the right person (you) the time to make their way toward me.</p>

            <p>Thank you for being a part of my life, thank you for giving me the chance to finally know what it is to love and to be loved. Now I know that it's not scary to be in a committed relationship, that it actually helps you grow into a better person for the one you love. And I think I'm ready to discover what the future has for us. I love you a lot Nounours. Happy birthday</p>
